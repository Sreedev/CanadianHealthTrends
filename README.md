# CanadianHealthTrends - MVP1
A study of factors impacting Canada's health and more

##Project scope
1. In this project, we want to use health data from Statistics Canada to find out which diseases and health problems affect Canadians the most. By combining and studying this data, we'll identify the most common health issues and how they affect different groups of people.
2. I also explored how environmental factors impact the health of Canadians. We'll gather data on air and water quality, climate trends, and urbanization. By analyzing this data alongside health statistics, we'll identify which environmental factors correlate most strongly with prevalent health conditions.
3. We'll clean up the data, analyze it to see patterns and use graphs and charts to show what we find.
